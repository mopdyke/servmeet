## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mopdyke/servmeet/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

You will have to allow your android device to install from unknow sources. To do this - depending on your version - go to Menu > Settings > Applications and make sure “Unknown sources” is checked. You're also going to need a file browser app so that you can view the files in your phone's storage.
